# Serenity

Our sem-VI Python project involved developing a mental health app entirely using Python. From start to finish, we utilized Python programming to design, build, test, and debug the app. Building a mental health app in Python offered us a chance to apply our theoretical knowledge practically, and we gained valuable experience in project management, software development, and testing
